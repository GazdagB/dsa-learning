# 🧠 DSA Learning & Practice

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms** (DSA) practice repository!  
I'm using this space to **learn**, **revisit**, and **sharpen** my understanding of core DSA concepts — with real code examples in **JavaScript** and **Java**.

## 📁 Repo Structure

```bash
dsa-learning/
├── algorithms/
│   ├── searching/
│   │   ├── linear/
│   │   │   ├── java/
│   │   │   ├── js/
│   │   │   └── README.md

│   └── ...
└── README.md
``` 

Each algorithm has:

- ✅ A separate folder

- ✅ Language-specific subfolders (currently Java & JS)

- ✅ Its own README.md to explain logic, edge cases, time/space complexity, etc.

## 🤝 Contribute!
Want to help out? Amazing!

💡 I’d love for this to become a multilingual DSA hub, so if you're comfortable in other languages like Python, C++, Go, Rust, etc., feel free to:

- Add implementations to existing folders

- Create new folders for other algorithms

- Improve or expand the README.md files (explanations, visuals, complexity analysis, etc.)

Just make a pull request with a clear description — all contributions are welcome! 🙌

## 🚀 Why this exists
- Although I already have some knowledge of DSA, I wanted to:
- Revisit the fundamentals with clean implementations
- Practice writing efficient and readable code
- Document the process for future me (and others!)
