# ðŸš€ Selection Sort

Selection Sort is an easy-to-understand sorting algorithm. It works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and putting it at the beginning.

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

Selection Sort finds the minimum value in an array and swaps it with the first unsorted element. This process is repeated for every subsequent element until the entire array is sorted. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Start with the first element of the array.
2. Find the smallest element in the unsorted part of the array.
3. Swap the smallest element found with the first unsorted element.
4. Repeat this process for the remaining unsorted part of the array.

## Time Complexity

Selection Sort is efficient in terms of space, but itâ€™s not the fastest when it comes to time complexity. Here's how its time complexity breaks down:

- **Best, Average, and Worst Case:** O(n^2) â€“ The algorithm will perform n^2 comparisons in every case, even if the array is already sorted.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) â€“ Selection Sort sorts in-place, requiring no extra memory.
